<p><b>Images of Earth can have the power to inspire reflection and action.<b> From the iconic Blue Marble from Apollo 17 to the Pale Blue Dot of Voyager 1, technological advances have encouraged us to see our planet from a different perspective and focus on a core concept: <i>impermanence</i>.</p>

<p>Our planet is dynamic and always changing; with atmospheric and oceanic cycling, erosion, aridification, reforestation, etc., nothing is permanent. Humans understand this from images generated by satellite sensors and from scientific simulations of the Earth system. Our representations of Earth ‚Å†‚Äî planets in silico ‚Å†‚Äî are also impermanent and offer a multiverse of (mostly) digital ‚Äúrealities‚Äù for us to explore.</p>

<p><b>As a celebration of our planet, I am offering digital or physical representations of Earth-like planets.</b> As with our choices on Earth, there are no perfect answers. You can choose to purchase a digital non-fungible token that I‚Äôve minted on the Polygon blockchain or a physical print (11x14in) that I will package and ship (or, of course, you can choose to just browse the images and appreciate our diverse planet).</p>

<p>For each purchase, I will ‚Äúburn‚Äù their physical or digital twin, as an act of destruction that should make us pause and consider: what do you value? What are the consequences of your decision for either the dynamic digital planet with an ever-changing atmosphere or the static physical memorial for a planet that once existed in bits and bytes? The digital version will receive a video of the burning of the physical print. The physical version will receive a certification of the destruction of the digital token.</p>

<p>Half of the proceeds from this sale will go to organizations that I think are doing good work for Earth, including <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.tpl.org/‚Äù>The Trust for Public Land</a>, <a href=‚Äùhttps://spark.eco/‚Äù>Spark Eco</a>, and <a href=‚Äùhttps://theoceancleanup.com/‚Äù>The Ocean Cleanup</a>.</p>
